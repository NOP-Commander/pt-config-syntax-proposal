##
## this is a draft of a proposal for a future config syntax in profit trailer
##
## - syntax is case-insensitive. iT dOEsNt mAttER hOw keYs ANd vALueS ArE wRiTtEn (issue #297)
## - settings which are prefixed with "default." can be overridden
##   with coin-specific values (never change a winning concept)
## - settings are grouped with prefix to reflect their scope
## - all settings could basically go into a single file but it
##   should possible and up to the user whether to split (for
##   convenience and/or readability) or not to split
## - split-up config files might be named "filename.properties"
## - on startup profit trailer imports all files named "*.properties"
##   from the folder "initialization"
## - all three config files (pairs, dca and indicators) could be
##   merged into a single super-config-file if the user is up to do so
## - well formed config files kick ass
##
## this is an example for indicators.properties using the proposed config syntax
