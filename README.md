# pt-config-syntax-proposal
proposal for a new config-syntax in Profit Trailer - sample config files are here

referring issue https://github.com/taniman/profit-trailer-enhancements/issues/303

feel free to leave some comments. thank you!

note: i didn't include all available config-keys from Profit Trailer in my sample files. i just transformed the config-files which came with Profit Trailer 2.0. So what you see is a subset but sufficient enough to explain the concept behind my brainfart.
