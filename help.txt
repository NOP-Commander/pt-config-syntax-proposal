let me show you how i think some logic link for buy/sell strategies could be implemented in config-syntax.

the property is named "required" and can be found on the following config-keys.

1. buy strategies which can be overridden per coin

default.buy.strategy.lowbb.required = true/false
default.buy.strategy.macd.required = true/false
default.buy.strategy.emaspread.required = true/false
default.buy.strategy.rsi.required = true/false

2. sell strategies which can be overridden per coin

default.sell.strategy.highbb.required = true/false
default.sell.strategy.gain.required = true/false
default.sell.strategy.rsi.required = true/false

3. dca buy strategies which can be overridden per coin

default.dca.buy.strategy.anderson.required = true/false		// does this make sense?
default.dca.buy.strategy.lowbb.required = true/false
default.dca.buy.strategy.macd.required = true/false
default.dca.buy.strategy.rsi.required = true/false

4. dca sell strategies which can be overridden per coin

default.dca.sell.strategy.gain.required = true/false
default.dca.sell.strategy.highbb.required = true/false
default.dca.sell.strategy.rsi.required = true/false
default.dca.sell.strategy.stoploss.required = true/false		// does this make sense?



Examples:

1. some set to true, some set to false

default.buy.strategy.macd.required = true
default.buy.strategy.rsi.required = false

- start trailing when macd and at least one more strategy with "required" set
  to "false" are triggered by their buy_values

2. all set to false

default.buy.strategy.macd.required = false
default.buy.strategy.rsi.required = false

- start trailing when any strategy with "required" set
  to "false" is triggered by its buy_values

3. all set to true

default.buy.strategy.macd.required = true
default.buy.strategy.rsi.required = tre

- start trailing when macd and rsi and at least one more strategy
  with "required" set to "false" are triggered by their buy_values



pitfalls/logic bombs

- if you have enabled just one buy/sell strategy, it doesn't matter
  whether you set "required" to "true" or "false".
- if you have enabled two buy strategies and both have "required" set
  to "true", there is no other strategy to wait for since no more are
  enabled. this setting should behave exactly like one strategy set
  to "true" and the other one to "false".
